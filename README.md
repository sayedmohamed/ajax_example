============


## Minimal working example of using AJAX with django

* Very simple data model, with sqlite database of fruits, vegetables and animals.
* simple template with a select box and a results div
* 2 views (one home view to render template and one ajax view)
* uses jQuery .load() to update the results when the selector changes state
